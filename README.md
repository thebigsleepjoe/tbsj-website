# TBSJ Website

This is a website dedicated to showcasing my portfolio.

It is a simplistic Next.js website using Tailwind CSS and React for the heavily-lifting.

There is some custom CSS styling and animations thrown in there, as well as some pretty gradients
and stock images.

Check out the website [here](https://www.bigsleepjoe.com/). Hopefully it stays up for the forseeable future.
