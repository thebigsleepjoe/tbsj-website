# Welcome!

I was thinking that if I was going to push changes to my website to add a blog,
I should probably have something in the way of an article ready to read.

But I was lazy. So this is all you get for now. 

I plan to post actual stuff as I feel like it, especially since
this article is just a markdown file anyway ;)
